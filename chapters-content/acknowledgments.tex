I have received a great deal of support and guidance throughout this dissertation, and would like to start by thanking my project supervisor, Dr David Harris-Birtill, whose expertise in the domain of machine learning has been invaluable to this project. I would like to extend my thanks to my project's co-supervisor, Lewis McMillan, for his practical knowledge of implementing deep learning systems, and to my team members, Ashay Patel and Shuen-Jen Shen, for their intuitive insights and help when developing the code.\\

Finally, I would like to thank all my family and friends, especially my mother, father, sister and grandmother, for their love, encouragements and support to pursue my dreams
