I have received a great deal of support and guidance throughout my Masters degree at the University of St Andrews and would like to take the opportunity to thank those who helped me and motivated to always improve throughout this year.

First of all, I would like to thank my project supervisor, Dr David Harris-Birtill, whose expertise in the domain of machine learning has been invaluable to this project. I would like to extend my thanks to my project's co-supervisor, Lewis McMillan, for his practical knowledge of implementing deep learning systems, and to my team members, Ashay Patel and Shuen-Jen Shen, for their intuitive insights and help when developing the code in the middle of a pandemic.\\

Finally, I would like to thank all my family and friends, especially my mother, father, sister and grandmother, for their love, encouragement and support to pursue my dreams.
