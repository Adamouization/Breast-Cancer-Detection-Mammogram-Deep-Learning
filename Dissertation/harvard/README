# harvard family of bibliographic styles
# Copyright 1994 - Peter Williams peterw@archsci.arch.su.edu.au

This is version 2.0.5 of the harvard family of bibliographic styles.
It is a bug fix of 2.0 which was a major rewrite to bring the sty file into
line with the new latex described in ``The LaTeX Companion''.  Due to the
efforts of Thorsten Schnier (thorsten@archsci.arch.su.edu.au) it incorporates
support for the LaTeX to html translator by Nikos Drakos
(nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk).

It includes a fixes by Berwin A. Turlach (berwin@alphasun.anu.edu.au) for
problems with \AtBeginDocument introduced in the latest version of LaTeX2e
and problems with the \nocite command.

A new style apsr.bst (American Political Science Review) is enclosed

NB.  The file harvard.sty makes considerable use of features in the new latex
that were not present in latex version 2.09 and is, therefore, not compatible
with that version.  However, the *.bbl files produced by the various bst files
should be still useable with latex version 2.09.
