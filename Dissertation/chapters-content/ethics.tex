The deep learning model will require real-life human data to learn its underlying patterns in order to detect cases of breast cancer in mammograms and to evaluate its performance. Therefore, the main ethical concern when using this sensitive medical data is whether it can be traced back to the original patient. As a result, fully anonymised, open-source and public datasets are used. After filling out the Preliminary Ethics Self-Assessment Form, it is determined that a full Ethics Application needs to be submitted and approved by the Ethics Committee.\\

The approval letter from the University of St Andrew's Teaching and Research Ethics Committee concerning the ethical application submitted for this research project can be found in Appendix~\ref{ch:appendix-ethical-approval-letter}.
