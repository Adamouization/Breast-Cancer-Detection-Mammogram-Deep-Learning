\section{Future Work}

Artefact removal (e.g. tags on the mammogram images).\\

More advanced image processing, as it is often an area where a large performance gains can be found \citep{Litjens2017}, by using techniques such as global contrast normalisation (GCN), local contrast normalisation, and Otsuâ€™s threshold segmentation.

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:conclusions-limitations}

Data bias (dataset mainly white, different manifestations of breast cancer amongst different people)?\\

GPU size limited to 6GB (can  train on larger image sizes with large GPUs) \citep{Shen2017}.
